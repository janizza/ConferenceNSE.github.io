<h3> Mental Health & Neoliberalism 26.01.2018 </h3>
<p>Can today's crisis in mental health be seen as the result of neoliberalism?

This discussion will center upon the aftermath of the 2007/08 financial crisis and the austerity policies which followed, citing how the slashing of expenditure on public services and increase in private debt has been met with questions around whether these factors are exacerbating mental health problems.

This event titled, ‘Mental Health and Neoliberalism’, will seek to situate the growing awareness of psychological distress in relation to such exogenous cultural and economic structures of oppression, but also examine how new technologies may be amplifying certain self-obsessive psychological states, such as attention and feedback addiction from social media and mobile devices.

Each speaker will give a presentation of their research on this topic, before engaging in a Q&A with the audience.

Panel:
Dr William Davies
Co-director of Political Economy Research Centre, Goldsmiths University, Author of The Happiness Industry: How the Government sold us well-being

Dr Ruth Cain
Senior Lecturer in Law, University of Kent
Medical Ethics and Law, Mental Health Law

Dr Jay Watts
Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Psychotherapist, Writer and Activist

<h3> Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and the Future of Work 04.12.2017</h3>

<p>Do blockchain technologies have the potential to disrupt monetary systems and power structures? And can this new technology lead to a more equitable economy?
New School Economics Goldsmiths and Hacksmiths - Goldsmiths Tech Society welcomes Atlas.Work developer and Cyber-Security Expert Patrick Lismore to Goldsmiths, University of London to first of all explain what blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are, how to engage with them and why the Atlas platform aims to disrupt how we work online.
The goal is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain, cryptography, and new fundraising methods which give rise to a variety of innovative technologies and platforms. As well as introducing a guideline to securely acquire, store and exchange cryptocurrencies.
Atlas will then be introduced as a new global freelancing platform that incorporates blockchain technologies to create a decentralized ecosystem that aims to reach across borders and revolutionize the freelance industry. </p>

<h3> Screeing of 'Dispossesion' with Q&A 13.11.2017</h3>

<p>In 2017 housing rose to the top of the British political agenda for the first time in a generation. But despite the media spotlight, few stories examined the catastrophic long-term failures that resulted in a chronic shortage of social housing in the United Kingdom. ‘Dispossession: The Great Social Housing Swindle’ explores the agenda behind the neglect, demolition and regeneration of council estates in the U.K. over the past thirty years. The film reveals how individuals and communities are fighting against the state and private developers, as they try to save their homes from demolition, while investigating the decisions that turned a crisis into a tragedy. Dispossession is the story of people who know that housing is not an expensive luxury, but a fundamental human right.
The Q&A included: Kiran Acharya, executive producer of Dispossession, Samiah Anderson, founder of New School Economics and campaigner for Justice for Grenfell, Sharon Hunt, specialist in social housing

<h3> Michael Jacobs - 'A New  Vision for the British Economy'11.10.2017</h3>

<p>The IPPR Commission on Economic Justice will rethink economic policy for post-Brexit Britain. At this event the Director of the Commission lays out its findings and proposals, for how the UK economy needs to be reformed around a new national economic vision and policy that can generate sustainable growth and broadly-shared prosperity. A response will be made by Dr Inga Rademacher and Dr Paul Gunn, both lecturers in the Department of Politics and International Relations.
Michael Jacobs is an economist and visiting professor in the School of Public Policy at University College London. From 2004–2007 he was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers at the Treasury, and from 2007–2010 a special adviser to the prime minister, with responsibility for energy, environment and climate policy. From 2010–2015 he advised governments and others on international climate change policy in the run-up to the UN Climate Conference in Paris in December 2015. He was a founder and senior adviser to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, for whose reports Better Growth, Better Climate (2014) and Seizing the Global Opportunity (2015) he was a lead author.

<h3> Rethinking Economics in a Post-Truth World Conference 01.07.2017</h3>
<p>The rise of populism and 'post-truth' politics is a rejection of a narrow, technocratic vision of economics. The distance between technical economic expertise and the democratic public sphere is a failing of economics. How can alternative perspectives on economic life contribute to more participatory and inclusive economic debates? What might rival disciplines contribute here?

The students of Goldsmiths Rethinking Economics Society and PERC, bring together a series of trans-disciplinary lectures and workshops based around demystifying economics. The day will consist of lectures, workshops and film screenings, with themes ranging from anthropological perspectives on the economy, to platform cooperatives, environmental policy, and decolonising economics. The talks and interactive workshops aim to inspire a broader definition of economics, and through a pluralist and multi-disciplinary lens, confront the prevailing power of economics, and its role in contemporary political debates.

Speakers included: Brett Scott, Campaigner and author of ‘The Heretic's Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money’

<h3> Our Internet: Building a Platform Cooperative 25.01.2017</h3>
<p>New School Economic's first event of the term will be an evening with Jack Thorp from Fairmondo UK, on visions and practicalities of a cooperative internet!
When four out of the five most valued companies in the world are internet corporations, what ideas are there to share the wealth of the digital economy?
</p>

Join us at Out of the Brew on New Cross Rd for drinks and discussion on the lessons learned from building the platform coop Fairmondo in the UK.

<h3>Pluralist Economics: Is it scientifc? 20.01.2017</h3>
<p>The aim is to set the scene for a discussion of teaching from a pluralist perspective by considering how we produce, and convey, reliable knowledge in economics. Using Kuhn’s framework as a basis for considering different understandings of what constitutes reliable knowledge (propagated through teaching), we focus on the different understandings within mainstream economics and within non-mainstream paradigms. Keynes’s epistemology (as developed in A Treatise on Probability) is then explored as a basis for a pluralist approach to economic knowledge.The mainstream critique of alternative approaches to knowledge, interpreted as ‘anything goes’, is addressed and the argument developed that a pluralist approach generates more reliable knowledge than the monist mainstream approach. This analysis leads to a set of positive and negative heuristics as a guide for pluralist economists as researchers. The case is made for teaching by debates, drawing on history of thought and methodology.</p>

<h3> Feminist Economics with Katrine Marcal 07.12.2016</h3>
<p> Who Cooked Adam's Smith Dinner? When Adam Smith wrote that all our actions stem from self-interest and the world turns because of financial gain he brought to life 'economic man'. Selfish and cynical, economic man has dominated our thinking ever since and his influence has spread from the market to how we shop, work and date. But every night Adam Smith's mother served him his dinner, not out of self-interest but out of love.
Today, our economics focuses on self-interest and excludes all other motivations. It disregards the unpaid work of mothering, caring, cleaning and cooking. It insists that if women are paid less, then that's because their labour is worth less - how could it be otherwise?
Swedish writer Katrine Marçal rewrites the story of the Homo Economicus when she observes that "[f]eminism has always been about economics. Virginia Woolf wanted a room of her own, and that costs money". </p>
