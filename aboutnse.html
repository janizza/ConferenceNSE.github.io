<h1> About New School Economics </h1>
<p>Our Mission is to build an open and collaborative community of economic thinkers. To expand the creativity and social awareness of our future economists and citizens. And finally, to bring the basic tools of economic analysis into the hands of all of us who participate in a society shaped by economic forces.

<h3>Pluralist Economics: Is it scientifc? 20.01.2017</h3>
<p>The aim is to set the scene for a discussion of teaching from a pluralist perspective by considering how we produce, and convey, reliable knowledge in economics. Using Kuhn’s framework as a basis for considering different understandings of what constitutes reliable knowledge (propagated through teaching), we focus on the different understandings within mainstream economics and within non-mainstream paradigms. Keynes’s epistemology (as developed in A Treatise on Probability) is then explored as a basis for a pluralist approach to economic knowledge.The mainstream critique of alternative approaches to knowledge, interpreted as ‘anything goes’, is addressed and the argument developed that a pluralist approach generates more reliable knowledge than the monist mainstream approach. This analysis leads to a set of positive and negative heuristics as a guide for pluralist economists as researchers. The case is made for teaching by debates, drawing on history of thought and methodology.</p>

<h3> Feminist Economics with Katrine Marcal 07.12.2016</h3>
<p> Who Cooked Adam's Smith Dinner? When Adam Smith wrote that all our actions stem from self-interest and the world turns because of financial gain he brought to life 'economic man'. Selfish and cynical, economic man has dominated our thinking ever since and his influence has spread from the market to how we shop, work and date. But every night Adam Smith's mother served him his dinner, not out of self-interest but out of love.
Today, our economics focuses on self-interest and excludes all other motivations. It disregards the unpaid work of mothering, caring, cleaning and cooking. It insists that if women are paid less, then that's because their labour is worth less - how could it be otherwise?
Swedish writer Katrine Marçal rewrites the story of the Homo Economicus when she observes that "[f]eminism has always been about economics. Virginia Woolf wanted a room of her own, and that costs money". </p>
